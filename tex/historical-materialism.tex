\chapter{Historical Materialism}

The materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the
production of the means to support human life and, next to production, the
exchange of things produced, is the basis of all social structure; that in every
society that has appeared in history, the manner in which wealth is distributed
and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced,
how it is produced, and how the products are exchanged.
