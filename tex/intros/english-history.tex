When Europe emerged from the Middle Ages, the rising middle-class of the towns
constituted its revolutionary element. It had conquered a recognized position
within medieval feudal organization, but this position, also, had become too
narrow for its expansive power. The development of the middle-class, the
\emph{bourgeoisie}, became incompatible with the maintenance of the feudal
system; the feudal system, therefore, had to fall.
