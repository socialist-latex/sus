\chapter{The Development of Utopian Socialism}

Modern Socialism is, in its essence, the direct product of the recognition, on
the one hand, of the class antagonisms existing in the society of today between
proprietors and non-proprietors, between capitalists and wage-workers; on the
other hand, of the anarchy existing in production. But, in its theoretical form,
modern Socialism originally appears ostensibly as a more logical extension of
the principles laid down by the great French philosophers of the 18th century.
Like every new theory, modern Socialism had, at first, to connect itself with
the intellectual stock-in-trade ready to its hand, however deeply its roots lay
in material economic facts.

The great men, who in France prepared men's minds for the coming revolution,
were themselves extreme revolutionists. They recognized no external authority of
any kind whatever. Religion, natural science, society, political
institutions---everything was subjected to the most unsparing criticism:
everything must justify its existence before the judgement-seat of reason or
give up existence. Reason became the sole measure of everything. It was the time
when, as Hegel says, the world stood upon its head%
\endnote{
  This is the passage on the French revolution:
  \quote{
    ``Thought, the concept of law, all at once made itself felt, and against
    this the old scaffolding of wrong could make no stand. In this conception
    of law, therefore, a constitution has now been established, and henceforth
    everything must be based upon this. Since the Sun had been in the firmament,
    and the planets circled around him, the sight had never been seen of man
    standing upon his head---i.e., on the Idea---and building reality after this
    image. Anaxagoras first said that the \emph{nous}, Reason, rules the world;
    but now, for the first time, had men come to recognize that the Idea must
    rule the mental reality. And this was a magnificent sunrise. All thinking
    Beings have participated in celebrating this holy day. A sublime emotion
    swayed men at that time, an enthusiasm of reason pervaded the world, as if
    now had come the reconciliation of the Divine Principle with the world.''
  }
}; first in the sense that the human head, and the principles arrived at by its
thought, claimed to be the basis of all human action and association; but by
and by, also, in the wider sense that the reality which was in contradiction to
these principles had, in fact, to be turned upside down. Every form of society
and government then existing, every old traditional notion, was flung into the
lumber-room as irrational; the world had hitherto allowed itself to be led
solely by prejudices; everything in the past deserved only pity and contempt.
Now, for the first time, appeared the light of day, the kingdom of reason;
henceforth superstition, injustice, privilege, oppression, were to be superseded
by eternal truth, eternal Right, equality based on Nature and the inalienable
rights of man.

In the meantime, along with and after the French philosophy of the 18th century,
had arisen the new German philosophy, culminating in Hegel.
